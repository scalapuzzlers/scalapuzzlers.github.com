  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    Object <tt>Private</tt> defines two classes <tt>C1</tt> and <tt>C2</tt>.
	<tt>C2</tt> is a private class which is only accessible in object <tt>Private</tt> and its companion class, 
	whereas <tt>C1</tt> is a public class with a private default constructor, so this class can only be 
	instantiated within class <tt>C1</tt>.
	</p><p>
	As a consequence, method <tt>foo2</tt> just compiles fine (as the private class <tt>C2</tt> is visible in
	class <tt>Private</tt>), whereas the implementation of method <tt>foo1</tt> reports the following compiler error:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
error: constructor C1 in class C1 cannot be accessed in class Private
         def foo1: Any = new Private.C1
                         ^
</pre>
    </p><p>
	Note, that the result type of method <tt>foo2</tt> has to be set to a base type of <tt>Private.C2</tt>, 
	otherwise the result type of this method would be a type which is invisible by any caller outside of 
	class/object <tt>Private</tt> (the compiler would report that the private class <tt>C2</tt> escapes its defining scope).
	For method <tt>foo1</tt> this is not necessary.
  </p>
