  <p>
    As explained by <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-language/H2tvh0O1iqA/HsphGXLc9foJ" target="_blank">Paul Phillips on scala-lang</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The field <tt>x</tt>, at the bytecode level, is an <tt>Object</tt> (it was declared in A and inherited). B specialized its type to <tt>Int</tt>, but the same storage is used. That means &quot;uninitialized Int&quot; behavior (as opposed to &quot;uninitialized reference&quot; behavior) depends on the contents of the field being unboxed into an <tt>Int</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The unboxing] happens when you call <tt>b.x</tt>, because <tt>x</tt> has type <tt>Int</tt>. That doesn't happen when you <tt>println(b.x)</tt>, because <tt>println</tt> takes an <tt>Any</tt> argument, so the expected type of the expression is <tt>Any</tt>. Scala doesn't understand any need to translate representations, because the expression has been upcast to <tt>Any</tt> already.
    </p>
    <p>Compare
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  scala> println(b.x: Any)
  null
  scala> println(b.x: Int)
  0
      </pre>
    </p>
