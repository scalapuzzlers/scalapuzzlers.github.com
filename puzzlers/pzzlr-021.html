<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
According to the SLS (Section 9.2) it is illegal to have a package with the same fully qualified name as a module or a class.
For example, on the following compilation unit
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
package com.scalapuzzlers
object base { class X }
package base { class X }
</pre>
the compiler will report an error:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
X.scala:3: error: base is already defined as object base
package base { class X }
        ^
one error found
</pre>
Top-level definitions outside a packaging however are assumed to be injected into a special empty package.
That package can neither be named nor imported, but the members of the empty package are visible to each other
without qualification.
</p>
<p>
The example above defines the package <tt>base</tt> and the top-level object <tt>&lt;empty&gt;.base</tt>, where the latter 
is visible without qualification, i.e. the object shadows the package.
Thus the first <tt>println</tt> statement would compile fine and print
<tt>object base</tt>.
The access to <tt>base.Y</tt> in the second <tt>println</tt> statement leads to the compiler error
<tt>type Y is not a member of object base</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Class <tt>Y</tt> in package <tt>base</tt> can be accessed
with a full qualified identifier:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
println((new _root_.base.Y).context)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Members of the empty package are however only visible from within the empty package, i.e. only from
other top-level classes. In all other packages, top-level objects and classes are not accessible.
Real projects will thus never use top-level classes.
