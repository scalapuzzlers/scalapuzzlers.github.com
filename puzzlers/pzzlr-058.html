  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    According to the SLS (&sect;6.16), &quot;the type of a conditional
    expression is the weak least upper bound&quot; of the types of its two
    branches. This is true even if only one of the branches can ever be chosen.
    In general, the weak least upper bound is the least common supertype of
    the types of the two branches, but if both branches return <em>numeric</em>
    types, as here, a different relationship is used to determine the overall
    type.
  </p>
  <p>
    This relationship is defined by &quot;weak conformance&quot;
    (SLS &sect;3.5.3), Scala's definition of the ranking of the primitive
    number types. These have a hierarchy, even though they are not sub- or
    supertypes of each other. In this hierarchy, <tt>Float</tt> ranks higher
    than <tt>Char</tt> (also a numeric type), so the overall type of
    the <tt>if</tt> statement is <tt>Float</tt>. The value of the character
    '5' is the value of its ASCII representation, 53, or 53.0 as a
    <tt>Float</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, '5' is only treated as a <tt>Float</tt> in the <em>second</em>
    <tt>println</tt> statement, since the compiler needs to know the type of
    the conditional expression in order to compile the subsequent call to
    method <tt>toString</tt>. In the case of the first <tt>println</tt>
    statement, the compiler never needs to determine the type of the
    <tt>if</tt> statement, because <tt>println</tt> takes an argument of type
    <tt>Any</tt>. So it can &quot; blindly&quot; pass on the value returned
    by the <tt>else</tt> branch, i.e. the character '5'.
