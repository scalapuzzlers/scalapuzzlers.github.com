  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    The usual case class implements an equals based on the arguments. Therefore, <tt>myBox</tt> and <tt>hisBox</tt> are equal as expected. But what is that syntax of <tt>yourBox</tt> assignment?
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no right-associativity going on, as it would suggest. But there is <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Predef%24%24ArrowAssoc.html">ArrowAssoc</a> that defines an implicit conversion for invocation of the <tt>-&gt;</tt> method. As a result, <tt>yourBox</tt> is a <tt>Tuple</tt> of <tt>(5, Box)</tt>. That obviously cannot be equal to <tt>myBox</tt>.
