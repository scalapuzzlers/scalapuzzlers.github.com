<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
<tt>f(a) _</tt> and <tt>f(a)(_)</tt> have different meanings, governed by
different sections of the Scala language specification.
</p>
<p>
<tt>f(a)(_)</tt> is the placeholder syntax for anonymous functions,
described in SLS 6.23.  Evaluation is deferred.
</p>
<p><tt>f(a) _</tt> is eta expansion, described in SLS 6.26.5.
Arguments given are evaluated eagerly; only the method call itself
is deferred.
</p>
<p>In this example, the eta expansion in
<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
val adder2 = add(counter) _
</pre>
causes eager evaluation, as described: as soon as that line is run, Scala actually evaluates counter and binds <tt>1</tt>, the result, to the <tt>counter</tt> argument for <tt>adder2</tt>. Hence <tt>x</tt> is <tt>1</tt> when first printed.
</p>
<p>
<tt>adder1</tt>, on the other hand, is an anonymous function, so its <tt>counter</tt> argument is only bound when <tt>adder1</tt> is evaluated. Since <tt>x</tt> is already <tt>1</tt> at this point, <tt>counter</tt> will be <tt>2</tt> and the evaluation of <tt>adder1</tt> prints <tt>12</tt>. The value of <tt>x</tt> is now <tt>2</tt>, as indicated by the program's output.
</p>
