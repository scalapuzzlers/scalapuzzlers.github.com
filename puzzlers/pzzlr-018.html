<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
Scala does not complain about unreachable code, therefore the code compiles fine.
If you want to be warned about unreachable code, then use the compiler option <tt>-Ywarn-dead-code</tt>.
If you want to see a compiler error instead of a warning, then in addition use the compiler option <tt>-Xfatal-warnings</tt>.

The answer to this question can be found in SLS &sect;6.20:
<blockquote>
A return expression <tt>return e</tt> must occur inside the body of some enclosing named
method or function. The innermost enclosing named method or function in a
source program, <em>f</em>, must have an explicitly declared result type, and the type of <tt>e</tt>
must conform to it. The return expression evaluates the expression <tt>e</tt> and returns its
value as the result of <em>f</em>. The evaluation of any statements or expressions following
the return expression is omitted.
</blockquote>
For the first <tt>return x</tt> statement the enclosing named method is method <tt>one</tt>, but
for the second <tt>return x</tt> statement the enclosing named method is method <tt>value</tt>.
When the function <tt>two(3)</tt> is called as part of the expression <tt>1 + one(2) + two(3)</tt>,
then the result <tt>3</tt> is returned <em>as the result of method <tt>value</tt></em>.
</p><p>
Btw, returning from a nested anonymous function is implemented by throwing and
catching a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl" target="_blank"><tt>scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl</tt></a>.
</p><p>
The most common reason you actually would want to return from inside a nested function is to 
break out of an imperative for-comprehension or resource control block.
See the answers to the Stack Overflow question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3771243/714104">Purpose of 
"return" statement in Scala?</a> for a further discussion of that aspect.
