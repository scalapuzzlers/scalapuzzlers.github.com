<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
Scala does not complain about unreachable code bloks, therefore the code compiles fine.
</p><p>
The answer to this question can be found in section 6.20 of the SLS:
<blockquote>
A return expression <tt>return e</tt> must occur inside the body of some enclosing named
method or function. The innermost enclosing named method or function in a
source program, <em>f</em>, must have an explicitly declared result type, and the type of <tt>e</tt>
must conform to it. The return expression evaluates the expression <tt>e</tt> and returns its
value as the result of <em>f</em>. The evaluation of any statements or expressions following
the return expression is omitted.
</blockquote>
This means, that the statement <tt>return x</tt> in our example returns from the 
method <tt>value</tt> (and therefore this method explicitly declares its result type).
When the function <tt>one(2)</tt> is called as part of the expression <tt>1 + one(2) + one(3)</tt>,
then the result 2 is returned <em>as the result of method <tt>value</tt></em>.
</p><p>
Btw, returning from a nested anonymous function is implemented by throwing and
catching a <tt>scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnException</tt>.
</p><p>
The most common reason you actually would want to return from inside a nested function is to 
break out of an imperative for-comprehension or resource control block.

"return" statement in Scala?</a> for a further discussion of that aspect.
