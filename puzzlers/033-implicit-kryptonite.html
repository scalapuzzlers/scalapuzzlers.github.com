  trait Messages { def greeting: String }
  trait Printer { def print(msg: String) }
  object NormalDay {
    implicit val EverydayMessages = new Messages { val greeting = "Hello, world!" }
    implicit val ConsolePrinter = new Printer {
      def print(msg: String) { println(msg) }
    }
  }
  object SunnyDay {
    implicit val HappyMessages = new Messages { val greeting = "What a nice day!" }
    implicit val ConsolePrinter = new Printer {
      def print(msg: String) { println(s"$msg :-)") }
    }
  }

  import NormalDay._
  implicitly[Printer] print implicitly[Messages].greeting

  {
    import SunnyDay._
    implicitly[Printer] print implicitly[Messages].greeting
  }
possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: The first prints
    code: Hello, world!
    text2: and the second fails with a compilation error
  b:
    code: |
      Hello, world!
      What a nice day! :-)
  c:
    code: |
      Hello, world!
      What a nice day!
  d:
    code: |
      Hello, world! :-)
      What a nice day! :-)

explanation: |
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf" target="_blank">SLS &sect;7.2</a>:
    <blockquote>If there are several eligible arguments which match the implicit parameter's type, a most specifc one will be chosen using the rules of static overloading resolution (&sect;6.26.3).</blockquote>
    If the rules for static overloading resolution cannot determine a most specific type, this results in an error, as is the case here:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  <console>:17: error: ambiguous implicit values:
   both value EverydayMessages in object NormalDay of type => Messages{val greeting: String}
   and value HappyMessages in object SunnyDay of type => Messages{val greeting: String}
   match expected type Messages
                  implicitly[Printer].print(implicitly[Messages].greeting)
                                                    ^
    </pre>
    So far, so unremarkably according to the spec. What is puzzling here is that importing an implicit in an inner scope does not override the <tt>default</tt> declaration in the outer scope, even though implicits are often intended to be &quot;overridden&quot; in this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, if we choose the same <em>name</em> for the &quot;overridding&quot; implicit (as is the case with <tt>ConsolePrinter</tt>), we achieve the intended result:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  ...
  object SunnyDay {
    implicit val EverydayMessages = new Messages { val greeting = "What a nice day!" }
  ...
  {
    import SunnyDay._
    implicitly[Printer].print(implicitly[Messages].greeting)
  }
  What a nice day! :-)
    </pre>
    This is because <em>name</em> resultion, unlike implicit resolution, means that <tt>ConsolePrinter</tt> declared in the inner scope has higher precedence than the default value in the outer scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, if we happen to know the <em>name</em> of the implicit we are trying to &quot;override&quot;, we can achieve the intended result. But since implicits are essentially anonymous, having to know the <em>name</em> of one to be able to override it seems an odd requirement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the default implicit is provided by external code, where its name might change at any time, this results in brittle code, too. At least the &quot;ambiguous implicit values&quot;error message helpfully provides the name of the implicit that we need to override.
