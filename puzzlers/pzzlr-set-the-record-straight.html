  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    The "toSet" method is parameterless and therefore paranthesis mean calling the apply method of the returned object. Luckily(or not) the returned Set has an apply method that tells us if given element is in the set. But it takes an argument! So what is going on?
  </p>
  <p>
    Compiler tries to make sense of this by interpreting is like 
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">(List("1", "2").toSet apply ()) + "3"</pre>
    Taking the parenthesis to mean Unit. But this still shouldn't work as Unit is not a string. But they have a common supertype: Any, and toSet takes(infers) a type parameter of the returned type.
  </p>
  <p>
    So after desugaring the code looks like
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">List("1", "2").toSet[Any].apply(()) + "3"</p>
  </p>
  By now it should be pretty obvious how this evaluates. It creates List[String] and then converts it into a Set[Any] (still having the same elements) and then checks if () - which is a member of Any - is present in this set. And it's not so you get false. This is converted to string and concatenated with "3" for the final answer "false3".
