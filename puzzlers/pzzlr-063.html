  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    The expression <tt>nats filter { _ % 2 != 0 }</tt> constructs a <em>new</em>
    stream that pulls elements from <tt>nats</tt> and passes on only those that
    match the filter. The second element of the filtered stream is thus the
    third element of <tt>nats</tt>, namely the value 3. Successive elements of
    <tt>nats</tt> can always be calculated because the next element of
    <tt>nats</tt> is simply the current element, plus 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of the stream <tt>odds</tt>, however, the filter is part of the
    recursive definition of the stream. This means that the only values that
    can be returned as elements of <tt>odds</tt> are those that pass the
    filter.
  </p>
  <p>
    This prevents the stream from calculating its second element, i.e. the
    first element of the stream
    <tt>odds map { _ + 1 } filter { _ % 2 != 0 }</tt>. The first attempt,
    using 1 (the first element of <tt>odds</tt>), does not pass the filter.
    The next attempt tries to use the second element of <tt>odds</tt> &ndash;
    but that is the precisely the value we are trying to calculate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attempt to calculate the second element of <tt>odds</tt> thus ends up
    calling itself recursively, leading to an endless loop and eventual
    <tt>StackOverflowError</tt>.
