  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    <tt>Double</tt> extends <tt>Ordering</tt>, which as a total order requires that a comparison between two values yield either a <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/library/scala/math/Ordering.scala#L77-L85" target="_blank">positive, negative or zero result</a>. However, <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/460bbc1276fb4ba83b9bcbdc7f7ba475b352b7c6" target="_blank">since 2.10.0</a> the comparison operations <tt>gt</tt>, <tt>lt</tt> and <tt>equiv</tt> for <tt>Double</tt> are implemented by the primitive operators <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>==</tt>. These are compliant with the IEEE floating-point specification, so all comparisons with <tt>NaN</tt> are false.
  </p>
  <p>
    This violates the expectations of the implementation of <tt>max</tt> in
    <tt>TraversableOnce</tt>, which tries to keep track of the greatest
    element so far by checking whether it is <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/library/scala/collection/TraversableOnce.scala#L230" target="_blank">larger than or equal to the next element</a>. If the comparison fails, the next element is assumed to be greater and
    is carried forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first case, this results in <tt>Double.NaN</tt> being chosen as
    &quot;greatest-so-far&quot; after the first comparison, since <tt>1.0</tt>
    is not larger than or equal to <tt>Double.NaN</tt>. In the next and final
    comparison for the first sequence, <tt>Double.NaN</tt> is in turn
    found to be not larger than or equal to <tt>1.1</tt>, so <tt>1.1</tt> is
    returned as the maximum value.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final comparison for the second sequence, on the other hand, concludes
    that <tt>1.1</tt> (the greatest value up to that point) is <em>not</em>
    larger than or equal to <tt>Double.NaN</tt>. Thus <tt>Double.NaN</tt> is
    returned as the maximum value instead.
  </p>
